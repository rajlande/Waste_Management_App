# ♻️ GreenSkill Project – AI-Based Waste Management System

A Streamlit-based AI application designed to classify and manage waste using machine learning models. This project supports environmental sustainability by promoting proper waste disposal through intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Features

- Waste classification using machine learning
- Visual data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Model performance evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, etc.)
- User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit
- Easily deployable to the cloud (Streamlit Sharing, HuggingFace, etc.)

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GreenSkill_Project.git
cd GreenSkill_Project
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖥️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Or if you're working directly from the notebook, open `GreenSkill_Project.ipynb` and run it cell by cell.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and includes labeled waste images categorized as:
- Recyclable
- Non-Recyclable
- Organic
- Hazardous

## ✅ Models Used

- Scikit-learn classifiers (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)
- XGBoost (for boosting accuracy)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 📈 Results

The model achieved:
- Accuracy: ~XX%
- Precision: ~XX%
- F1 Score: ~XX%

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Integrate image classification using CNN
- Deploy as a mobile app
- Add real-time waste sorting via camera
